# NYC Citi Bike Sharing Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of the analysis is to prepare visualizations for a business proposal requested by Des Monies to give potential investors a look into the highly successful NYC Citibike sharing program. The data for August 2019 was reviewed by looking at usage patterns based on geography, user types and Gender.

### Visualization 1

The NYC Citi Bike Dashboard is a summary of the data. Some key observations

 - The total number of rides for August is 2,344,224, while most of the Citi bike users are male. The **'Gender Breakdown'**    pie chart shows that males in NYC utilize the bike-sharing program almost three times as often as females.

 - Comparing visualizations for the **'Top Starting Locations'** and **'Top Ending Locations'**, we can see that the most active starting locations are also among the most active ending locations.

Looking at visualizations for 'Checkout Times for Users' and 'Checkout Times by Gender', we see that most rides are for 20 minutes or less and that the vast majority of rides are less than one hour. We also see that this pattern is the same regardless of Gender.
