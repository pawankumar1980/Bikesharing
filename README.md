# NYC Citi Bike Sharing Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of the analysis is to prepare visualizations for a business proposal requested by Des Monies to give potential investors a look into the highly successful NYC Citibike sharing program. The data for August 2019 was reviewed by looking at usage patterns based on geography, user types and Gender. 

## Results

### Visualization 1

The NYC Citi Bike Dashboard is a summary of the data. Some key observations

 - The total number of rides for August is 2,344,224, while most of the Citi bike users are male. The **'Gender Breakdown'**    pie chart shows that males in NYC utilize the bike-sharing program almost three times as often as females.

 - Comparing visualizations for the **'Top Starting Locations'** and **'Top Ending Locations'**, we can see that the most active starting locations are also among the most active ending locations.

Looking at visualizations for **'Checkout Times for Users'** and **'Checkout Times by Gender'**, we see that most rides are for 20 minutes or less and that the vast majority of rides are less than one hour. We also see that this pattern is the same regardless of Gender.


### Visualization 3

<img width="596" alt="Trips by Weekday For Each Hour" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111800568/206310004-4077e0f5-a5f0-430e-9efd-0eba05f5b09d.png">

The heatmap of **'Trips by Weekday per Hour'** shows a clear pattern of bicycle usage 
  - during the morning weekday commute (7-9 a.m.), 
  - during the evening weekday commute (4-7 p.m.) except on Wednesday evenings, and 
  - All day long on weekends.

### Visualization 4

The **'Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)'** heatmap shows that the usage pattern is actual regardless of Gender, although the total numbers for males are considerably higher

### Visualization 5

<img width="1228" alt="User Trips By Gender By Weekday" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111800568/206310644-69b1174c-9854-4a63-8b51-51d7449a0aea.png">

The **'User Trips by Gender by Weekday'** heatmap demonstrates the following points: subscribers are primarily male and account for most of the weekday activity, customers' Gender is often unknown, and usage on the weekend is split more evenly between subscribers and customers.

### Visualization 6

<img width="609" alt="Bike Repair   Utilization" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111800568/206310813-a940c826-f73d-4543-9575-88fb447351d1.png">

The  **'Bike Utilization' and 'Bike Repairs'** charts show that some bikes are used for many trips and total hours, while others are hardly used. More analysis is called for to assess whether there are predictable patterns of use for high- or low-use bikes.

### Additional Analysis

We recommend further analysis for a few points.

 - We have seen that most trips are for less than 30 minutes; further analysis is required to compare weekday and weekend trips.
 
 - Analysis of bikes with the highest usage - study the usage pattern concerning routes, starting and ending locations.
 
 - Ride Starting Locations by Gender

Males are more likely to start a trip farther than the main city center of NYC than others. 

 - Ride Ending locations by Gender

Males are likelier to end a trip across the river in the southwest of NYC than others.
